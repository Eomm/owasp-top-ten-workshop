# Introduction: OWASP

<div class="dense">

- The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software.

- OWASP has community-led open-source software projects, hundreds of local chapters worldwide, tens of thousands of members, and leading educational and training conferences

</div>

---

# Introduction: OWASP Top Ten

<div class="dense">

- The [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/Top10/) is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security.
- It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.

</div>

---

# Using the OWASP Top Ten

<div class="dense">

- On a new project, keeping the OWASP Top Ten in mind will help write resilient software from the start
- On an existing project, identify weaknesses and areas for improvement.
- Find the issues that need to be resolved immediately and those that can wait

</div>

# A note before starting

<div class="dense">

- This workshop is a condensed explanation of each category of vulnerability in the top 10 for training
- Those vulnerabilities are broad and complex and can apply in a variety of scenarios that can't all be covered in those slides
- More research for project-specific concerns is encouraged, and more advanced tools are provided at the end of this workshop

</div>

---

# The Top 10

<div class="dense">

- Let's now look at the 10 vulnerabilities in the list
- Each section will explain one of them.
- This includes common vulnerabilities, consequences, and ways to prevent them

</div>

---

# A01: Broken Access Control

<div class="dense">

- [AO1:2021 - Broken Access Control](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/)
- Access control enforces that a user can only act based on specific permissions
- Incorrect permissions can lead to unauthorised access of data, or users performing actions they shouldn't be allowed to

</div>

---

# A01 Broken Access Control (2): Common vulnerabilities

<div class="dense">

- Not applying principle of least privilege: Access to a function of resource is available to anyone
- Access control checks bypassed by modifying a request or tampering with page content
- Permitting viewing or editing someone else's account, by providing its unique identifier
- CORS misconfiguration allows API access from unauthorized/untrusted origins.
- ... And more on the OWASP website

</div>

---

# A01 Broken Access Control (3): How to Prevent

<div class="dense">

- Deny access by default
- Implement access control once and re-use (avoid duplication of related code)
- Enforce user ownership when manipulating data
- ... And more on the OWASP website

</div>

---

# A01 Attack 1: Editing query parameters

TODO: Add exercise description for a "get to someone else's account page by editing GET parameters" issue

---

# A02: Cryptographic Failures

<div class="dense">

- [A02: Cryptographic Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/)
- Failures related to insufficient or lack of cryptography of sensitive data
- Passwords, credit card numbers, health records, personal information, business secrets
- Anything protected by privacy laws or other regulations

</div>

---

# A02 Cryptographic Failures (2): Common vulnerabilities

<div class="dense">

- Usage of weak or outdated cryptographic algorithms like md5
- Cryptographic key safety: Weak keys, default keys, keys from online tutorials, keys checked in source control...
- Lack of traffic encryption (HTTPS)
- Insufficient entropy in seed generation

</div>

---

# A02 Cryptographic Failures (3): How to Prevent

<div class="dense">

- Identify sensitive data and make sure it is encrypted. Avoid storing sensitive data unnecessarily
- Use up to date and strong standard algorithms
- Proper key/secrets management (no checking private keys in git!)
- Disable caching for responses that contain sensitive data. Do not transport sensitive data over legacy protocols like FTP and SMTP

</div>

---

# A02 Attack

TODO: Add md5 password hashing exercise

- Server has a vulnerable user route showing the encrypted password for a user (for testing purposes)
- Password is hashed in md5, so we can find the real password and login
- Objective is to fix the encryption

---

# A03: Injection

<div class="dense">

- Injections are a form of attack where a malicious payload is able to effectively inject an arbitrary bit of query or code on the target server
- Common targets: SQL, NoSQL, ORM, LDAP, JS eval

</div>

---

# A03 Injection (2): Common vulnerabilities

<div class="dense">

- Lack of validation or sanitization of user input
- Dynamic queries or non-parameterized calls without context-aware escaping are used directly in the interpreter.
- Hostile data is used within object-relational mapping (ORM) search parameters to extract additional, sensitive records.

</div>

---

# A03 Injection (3): How to Prevent

<div class="dense">

- Prefer using a safe API that sanitizes input
- Escape special characters using the specific escape syntax for that interpreter.
- Avoid user-supplied table names or column names as they cannot be escaped
- Use LIMIT and other statements in queries to lower the impact of injections

</div>

---

# A03 Injection Attack

TODO: Server route passing unsanitised input to an eval or something which can be exploited to drop some js variables

---

# A04: Insecure Design

<div class="dense">

- Fundamental design flaws of the software can cause security issues
- Those issues cannot be fixed by a better more secure code implementation
- Failure to determine the clevel of security design required during design

</div>

---

# A04 Insecure Design: Examples

<div class="dense">

- A forgotten password flow with "security questions" is insecure by design because more than one person can know the answer
- An ecommerce website sells high-end video cards that scalpers buy with bots to resell, causing bad PR with customers. Most websites wouldn't need to design against bots, but due to the nature of the product being sold this one does.
- A cinema chain allows booking up to fifteen attendees before requiring a deposit. An attacker could make hundreds of small booking requests at once to block all seats, causing massive revenue loss.

</div>

# A04 Insecure Design: How to prevent

<div class="dense">

- Model threats for the application, all its flows and business logic
- Continuously evaluate security requirement and design during the development lifecycle
- Consider security rules and access controls for every user story
- Use unit and integration tests to verify the application is resistant to the threat model

</div>

---

# A05: Security Misconfiguration

<div class="dense">

- Badly configured servers or services can lead to vulnerabilities
- With increased usage of highly configurable software and cloud APIs, there are many opportunities for misconfiguration

</div>

---

# A05 Security Misconfiguration: Common Vulnerabilities

<div class="dense">

- Improperly configured permissions on cloud services
- Unnecessary features enabled: open ports, services, accounts with elevated accesss...
- Default credentials unchanged
- Out of date or vulnerable server
- Stack trace from error handling revealing information to users

</div>

---

# A05 Security Misconfiguration: How to prevent

<div class="dense">

- Repeatable, automated and fast to deploy environments lower risk of creating insecure environments or deployments
- Different credentials should be used in each environment
- Frequently review security updates, patches and permissions
- A segmented architecture increases security by separating components, tenants, containers or cloud security groups
- Automated testing against the configuration of all environments

</div>

---

# A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components

<div class="dense">

- Applications use a variety of components and libraries which can have security issues
- Vulnerable components can be an attack vector until they are patched
- Particularly relevant in the node.js world with an ever-growing NPM dependency tree

</div>

---

# A06 Vulnerable and Outdated Components: Common Vulnerabilities

<div class="dense">

- Not tracking versions of used components, including nested dependencies
- Using unsupported or vulnerable software, including OS, web server, database, APIs, libraries, components, runtimes...
- Not scanning for vulnerabilities regularly and subscribing to security news for used components
- Not fixing vulnerable dependencies in a timely fashion

</div>

---

# A07: Identification and Authentication Failures

<div class="dense">

- Verification of the user's identity is crucial to security
- Weak or vulnerable authentication systems can be attacked to gain access

</div>

---

# A07 Identification and Authentication Failures: Common Vulnerabilities

<div class="dense">

- Application allows brute forcing of credentials
- Allows default, weak or known passwords
- Exploitable credential recovery processes
- Lack of effective multi-factor authentication
- Unencrypted or weakly encrypted password storage

</div>

---

# A07 Identification and Authentication Failures: How to prevent

<div class="dense">

-

</div>

---

# A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures

<div class="dense">

- Code and infrastructure not protected against integrity violations
- Attackers gaining access to a plugin and deploy an unverified update which would get distributed to all its users

</div>

---

# A08 Software and Data Integrity Failures: Common Vulnerabilities

<div class="dense">

- Libraries coming from untrusted sources, repos or CDNs
- An insecure CI/CD pipeline
- Updates downloaded without sufficient integrity verification

</div>

---

# A08 Software and Data Integrity Failures: How to prevent

<div class="dense">

- Using digital signatures for integrity checks on data and downloaded software
- Ensure npm dependencies are trusted. For higher risks, host a custom repository of packages with internally vetted dependencies
- Use automated tools to verify that components don't contain known vulnerabilities
- Ensure there are code reviews for changes to minimise the risk of malicious code being introduced

</div>

---

# A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

<div class="dense">

- Proper logging and monitoring is critical to detecting and responding to breaches
- It is important for alerting, accountability, visibility and forensics of security incidents

</div>

---

# A10: Server Side Request Forgery

<div class="dense">

</div>

---

# Beyond the Top 10

<div class="dense">

- The OWASP Top 10 is a good introduction to the most common issues to keep in mind while developing
- By its nature, the Top 10 is a series of guidelines but can't be tested easily as its applications are broad
- On the other hand the [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/) is a comprehensive list of security criteria
- Those are specific, standardised and verifiable security requirements on which on app can be tested to either pass or fail

</div>

---

# Other useful OWASP resources

<div class="dense">

- The [OWASP Cheat Sheet Series](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org) provides condensed information on specific security topics related to OWASP standards
- The [OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model](https://owaspsamm.org) can help an organization analyze and improve their software security
